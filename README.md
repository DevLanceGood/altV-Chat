## Known Issues
1. There is some lag between events, you can see warning messages in server and client console:
* `Event handler at chat:file:///_/chat/server.mjs:5 was too long 16ms`
* `Event handler at chat:client.mjs:65 was too long 21ms`
2. Sometimes after reconnecting to server your client halts and few seconds later - crashes.
